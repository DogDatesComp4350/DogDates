## Description
This project will be similar to a dating app but will be for making playdates for dogs. Our target users will be dog owners who want to find playdates for their dogs. A user will be able to create an account, add information and pictures and then view other users' accounts and either ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ them. When two users like each other they have ‘matched’ and they are given new permissions such as the ability to see more information about each other, such as contact information, or possibly a chat feature to communicate with one another.
